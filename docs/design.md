## Performance Goal

This crate targets **maximum performance** — minimise latency and allocations without compromising correctness.

Real-time audio/video streaming is extremely latency-sensitive: every extra heap allocation and every unnecessary copy adds directly to user-perceived latency. Design decisions should prioritise zero-allocation / zero-copy on the hot path (the code path every audio chunk traverses).

### Hot Path Definition

The following paths execute every **100–250 ms** during 16 kHz audio streaming:

1. **Send**: raw PCM → base64 encode → assemble `RealtimeInput` JSON → WebSocket send
2. **Recv**: WebSocket recv → JSON parse → base64 decode audio → broadcast event

### Performance Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Buffer reuse** | Encoders / serializers on the hot path use pre-allocated buffers to avoid per-chunk allocation |
| **Zero-copy first** | Borrow (`&str` / `&[u8]`) whenever possible; only take ownership at task boundaries |
| **Batch-friendly** | API design allows callers to reuse a single encoder instance across a streaming loop |
| **Lazy conversion** | Don't perform conversions the caller didn't ask for (e.g. PCM bytes go straight to base64 — no forced f32 round-trip) |
| **Profile, don't guess** | Optimisations must be backed by benchmark data, not intuition |

### Known Performance Gaps

The protocol-layer allocation gaps that were tracked in the roadmap have now
been addressed. Keep using the checked-in benches and idle regression tests to
catch future regressions instead of assuming the current state will hold.

## Design Decision Records

### ADR-1: `ServerMessage` is a flat struct, not an enum

The protocol allows the server to include multiple top-level fields in a single JSON message (e.g. `serverContent` + `usageMetadata`). A flat struct with `Option` fields preserves this; `codec::into_events()` then decomposes it into semantically clear `ServerEvent` enum variants for the caller.

### ADR-2: `ClientMessage` is an externally-tagged enum

The protocol requires each client message to carry exactly one top-level field. Serde's externally-tagged enum (`#[serde(rename = "setup")]`) naturally produces `{"setup": { ... }}` — no manual `Serialize` impl needed.

### ADR-3: Reconnection strategy

- Exponential backoff: `base × 2^(attempt − 1)`, capped at `max_backoff`
- GoAway → reconnect immediately (carrying the latest resume handle)
- Connection loss → apply backoff
- On reconnect, `sessionResumption.handle` is injected into the setup message automatically
- Transparent to the caller: sends buffer in the mpsc channel during downtime

### ADR-4: Session handle is Clone

Multiple async tasks often need to hold the same session simultaneously (one sending audio, another receiving events). Using `Arc` + `broadcast::Sender` / `mpsc::Sender` (both Clone) makes `Session` cheaply cloneable. Each clone has its own event cursor (its own `broadcast::Receiver`).

### ADR-5: Audio encoder buffer reuse

`AudioEncoder` writes the PCM → base64 conversion into pre-allocated internal
buffers and returns a borrowed `&str`. After the encoder has established enough
capacity, the encoding step itself avoids further heap allocation.

**Note:** `AudioEncoder` still matters when a caller needs reusable
PCM → base64 conversion for custom payload assembly, but the built-in
`Session::send_audio` path now keeps its own runner-side base64 / MIME / JSON
buffers. On the receive side, server inline audio is decoded during
deserialization into `Bytes`, so `codec::into_events` no longer allocates a
second owned audio buffer just to decompose the message.

### ADR-6: CLI setup changes are staged, then applied via explicit reconnect

Live API tools are part of the immutable `setup` payload for an open
connection. The CLI therefore separates:

- **desired tool profile** — changed by `/tools enable|disable|toggle`
- **active tool profile** — the profile on the currently connected session

`/tools apply` and `/system apply` promote staged setup changes by reconnecting
with a newly built `setup` payload. This keeps the command surface honest:
toggling a tool does not pretend to mutate a connection that the protocol says
is already configured.

The current implementation uses explicit session resumption when a
server-issued resumption handle is available, so conversation state can carry
over across the reconnect. If the server has not published a handle yet, the
apply fails explicitly instead of silently falling back to a fresh session.

### ADR-7: CLI user preferences live in harness-managed named profiles

The CLI now persists user-facing configuration inside the harness-owned profile
namespace. Each profile maps to one durable harness root under
`~/.gemini-live/harness/profiles/<profile>/`, and CLI-specific settings live in
`config/cli.json` within that root.

A profile captures:

- backend selection and credentials
- model selection
- system instruction
- staged tool profile
- microphone / speaker auto-start flags
- optional screen-share startup settings

Startup resolution is `environment > active profile > built-in defaults`. The
resolved values are then written back to the active profile so one explicit run
can seed future launches.

This design keeps startup deterministic and easy to explain: the active
profile is the durable source of truth for both CLI config and harness state,
while environment variables remain a simple override layer for automation or
one-off launches.

### ADR-8: Reusable host orchestration lives outside the CLI binary

The workspace now has a dedicated `gemini-live-runtime` crate for the layer
that sits above the base `gemini-live` session client and below concrete host
applications such as the desktop CLI or a future voice bot.

That crate is the natural home for:

- staged-vs-active `setup` orchestration
- a testable session-driver abstraction above `Session`
- shared runtime events for session forwarding and tool-call request fanout
- managed session forwarding above the Live session layer (`ManagedRuntime`)

The adjacent durable `gemini-live-harness` crate is now the natural home for:

- shared host tool execution contracts
- durable task, notification, and memory persistence
- harness-owned inline budget wrappers around blocking host tools

This avoids turning the CLI into the accidental source of truth for reusable
application logic, and it avoids creating a vague "utils" crate with no
clear architectural boundary.

### ADR-9: Desktop media adapters live in `gemini-live-io`

Desktop-specific mic, speaker, and screen-capture code now lives in a
dedicated `gemini-live-io` crate instead of the CLI binary.

That crate is the natural home for:

- microphone capture and AEC-backed cleaned PCM output
- speaker playback and AEC render-reference feeding
- screen-target enumeration and JPEG frame capture

This keeps the CLI focused on TUI product behavior and lets future desktop
hosts reuse the same media adapters without reaching into a binary crate.

### ADR-10: Discord host behavior lives in `gemini-live-discord`

The workspace now also has a dedicated `gemini-live-discord` crate for the
Discord-specific host layer that pairs `serenity` and `songbird` with the
shared Gemini runtime.

That crate is the natural home for:

- single-guild / single-owner routing policy
- configured target voice-channel discovery and creation
- Discord gateway intents and event handling
- the Songbird voice receive / playback bridge

This keeps Discord product logic out of the desktop CLI and avoids trying to
force Discord voice handling through the desktop-only `gemini-live-io` crate.

### ADR-11: Low-coupling tool families live in `gemini-live-tools`

The workspace now also has a dedicated `gemini-live-tools` crate for
tool families whose execution model is reusable across hosts and does not
depend on product-specific UI or long-lived device state.

That crate is the natural home for:

- workspace inspection and execution tools (`list_files`, `read_file`,
  `run_command`)
- shared tool selection data for those families
- function declarations and validation shared across hosts

The CLI continues to own host-specific composition, slash-command UX, desktop
device wiring, and CLI-specific profile contents layered on top of the
harness-owned profile root. This keeps low-coupling tool logic out of the
binary crate without pretending that desktop controls are already portable
enough to deserve the same treatment.

Desktop controls that mutate mic / speaker / screen-share state still remain
CLI-local. They now cross the tool/runtime boundary through an explicit
request-response port instead of reaching directly into terminal state. That
keeps the execution contract testable without claiming the tool family is
portable enough to move into `gemini-live-tools`.

### ADR-12: Durable harness state lives on disk, not in process memory

The workspace now also has a dedicated `gemini-live-harness` crate for the
control plane above `gemini-live-runtime` and below a concrete host.

That crate is the natural home for:

- durable delegated-task state under a filesystem root
- durable notification queues that survive process death
- durable long-running memory records that other local agents can inspect
- durable task, notification, and memory state managed behind host-facing harness APIs

The source of truth is the filesystem, not process memory. Any in-memory data
inside a host or worker is therefore only a cache or a transient execution
handle. Recovery after a crash or restart must be possible by scanning the
filesystem layout alone.
