# gemini-live-cli

Interactive TUI client for the Gemini Multimodal Live API. Serves as both
a practical tool and a living usage example of the `gemini-live` library.

## Quick Start

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key cargo run -p gemini-live-cli
```

Override the model:

```bash
GEMINI_MODEL=models/gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-latest cargo run -p gemini-live-cli
```

Use Vertex AI with a static bearer token:

```bash
LIVE_BACKEND=vertex \
VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1 \
VERTEX_MODEL='projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/MODEL_ID' \
VERTEX_AI_ACCESS_TOKEN="$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token)" \
cargo run -p gemini-live-cli
```

Use Vertex AI with Application Default Credentials:

```bash
LIVE_BACKEND=vertex \
VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1 \
VERTEX_MODEL='projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1/publishers/google/models/MODEL_ID' \
VERTEX_AUTH=adc \
cargo run -p gemini-live-cli --features vertex-auth
```

Select or create a named profile:

```bash
cargo run -p gemini-live-cli -- --profile work
```

Print the resolved config file path:

```bash
cargo run -p gemini-live-cli -- config
```

## Transcribe Mode

`gemini-live transcribe` opens a dedicated real-time speech-to-text TUI
backed by the Live Transcribe API (default model
`models/gemini-3.5-transcribe-live`, override with `--model` or
`GEMINI_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL`):

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key gemini-live transcribe -o notes.txt
```

Interim hypotheses render in gray italics and are replaced by finalized
transcript lines; with `--output`/`-o`, each finalized line is appended to
the file as it lands (`tail -f` friendly). Flags: `--lang`, `--mode
verbatim|smart`, `--vocab`, `--manual-vad`, `--source mic|system`.

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/mode [verbatim\|smart]` | Show or stage the transcript style. |
| `/lang [codes…\|clear]` | Show or stage BCP-47 language codes (`clear` = auto-detect). |
| `/vocab [list\|add <terms…>\|remove <term>\|clear]` | Inspect or stage custom vocabulary (≤1000 terms). |
| `/vad [on\|off]` | Show or stage automatic activity detection. |
| `/apply` | Reconnect with the staged settings (settings are setup-level); also serves as a manual reconnect. |
| `/source [mic\|system]` | Show or switch the audio source immediately (no reconnect). |
| `/start` / `/end` | Mark speech segments manually (only when VAD is off). |
| `/clear` | Clear the transcript pane; the output file is untouched. |

Both sources stream 16 kHz mono PCM in 100 ms chunks: `mic` runs the default
input device through the shared AEC pipeline, `system` captures the default
output device via backend loopback. macOS CoreAudio has no native loopback,
so `system` there requires a virtual output device (e.g. BlackHole); the
failure surfaces as a notice and the mic stays active. Sessions are capped at
10 minutes of continuous streaming upstream; the CLI reconnects automatically
and shows the elapsed time in the status bar.

Applied settings persist into the `transcribe` section of the active profile.
Canonical behavior lives in the module docs of
`crates/gemini-live-cli/src/transcribe/mod.rs` and `transcribe/startup.rs`.

## Profiles & Config

The harness now owns the filesystem-level profile mechanism. Each CLI profile
maps to one harness profile root under the local harness directory:

- `~/.gemini-live/harness/profiles/<profile>/`

CLI-specific config for that profile is stored inside the same root:

- `~/.gemini-live/harness/profiles/<profile>/config/cli.json`

If `--profile <name>` refers to a missing profile, the CLI creates it
automatically and saves resolved settings into that harness profile root.

The selected profile persists:

- backend selection and credentials
- model
- thinking level
- system instruction
- enabled tools
- microphone / speaker auto-start state
- optional screen-share target and interval

Startup precedence is:

1. Environment variables
2. Active profile values
3. Built-in defaults

Resolved startup settings are written back to the active profile, so exporting
`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, or `GEMINI_THINKING_LEVEL` for one run is
enough to seed a profile for later runs. This file may therefore contain
plaintext credentials.

## Canonical Behavior

The canonical description of the default CLI session profile now lives in the
module docs for `crates/gemini-live-cli/src/startup.rs`. Keep that source
comment in sync with the `SetupConfig` built by the CLI entrypoint.

Backend selection and auth-mode semantics are also documented in that module
doc and enforced by the startup config helpers in the same file.

## UI Layout

```
┌─ models/gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview ──────────────────┐
│   ready — @file for media, /mic /speak for audio        │
│ [you] hello                                             │

```

- **Top panel**: conversation history, auto-scrolls to bottom
- **Bottom panel**: always-active input — you can type while the model is responding
- **Status bar**: current state of audio/screen features
- **Output transcript**: shown as model text when output audio transcription is enabled

## Commands

### Text & Media

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `hello` | Send text to the model |
| `@photo.jpg` | Send an image file |
| `@recording.wav` | Send a WAV audio file |
| `@photo.jpg describe this` | Send image + text together (image first, text after 500ms delay) |

Supported image formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP.
Supported audio formats: WAV (any sample rate, auto mono mixdown), raw PCM (.pcm/.raw, assumed 16kHz mono).

File paths are currently parsed by splitting on whitespace. Paths containing
spaces are not supported yet.

### Slash Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/mic` | Toggle microphone input. Captures from the default input device, runs WebRTC AEC, and streams cleaned mono PCM to the API at 48 kHz. |
| `/speak` | Toggle speaker output. Plays model audio (24 kHz PCM) through the default output device, resampled to the device's native rate. When both mic and speak are on, the shared WebRTC AEC pipeline removes speaker echo from the mic signal. |
| `/share-screen list` | List available capture targets (monitors and windows) with IDs. |
| `/share-screen <id> [interval]` | Start sharing a monitor or window. `interval` is seconds between frames (default: 1). Example: `/share-screen 0 5` shares Display 1 every 5 seconds. |
| `/share-screen` | Stop screen sharing (when active). |
| `/system` | Show active vs staged system instruction. |
| `/system show` | Show active vs staged system instruction. |
| `/system set <text>` | Stage a new system instruction for the next applied session. Quote the text when it contains spaces you want preserved literally. |
| `/system clear` | Stage removal of the system instruction. |
| `/system apply` | Apply the staged system instruction and staged tools. If a session is currently hot, the CLI reconnects immediately with conversation carryover when a resume handle is available; if the CLI is dormant, the staged setup is armed for the next wake. |
| `/tools` | Show active vs staged tool profile. |
| `/tools list` | List the known tools and their current state (`active`, `staged`, `off`). |
| `/tools enable <tool>` | Stage a tool for the next applied session. Known tools: `google-search`, `timer`, `list-files`, `read-file`, `run-command`, plus feature-gated CLI-local desktop tools such as `desktop-microphone`, `desktop-speaker`, and `desktop-screen-share`. |
| `/tools disable <tool>` | Stage a tool removal for the next applied session. |
| `/tools toggle <tool>` | Flip a tool in the staged profile. |
| `/tools apply` | Apply the staged tool profile and staged system instruction. If a session is currently hot, the CLI reconnects immediately with conversation carryover when a resume handle is available; if the CLI is dormant, the staged setup is armed for the next wake. |

When the input starts with `/`, the CLI shows slash-command completions in a
popup above the input box. `Tab` accepts the selected completion and `Up` /
`Down` switch the highlighted suggestion.

### Keyboard

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send input / execute command |
| `Tab` | Accept the highlighted slash-command completion |
| `Up` / `Down` | Move the slash-command completion selection (when visible) |
| `Backspace` | Delete last character |
| `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` / `Ctrl-D` | Quit |

## Feature Flags

Each slash command group is a separate Cargo feature, all enabled by default:

| Feature | Dependencies | Enables |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `mic` | `gemini-live-io/mic`, `gemini-live-io/aec` | `/mic` command with AEC-backed microphone capture |
| `speak` | `gemini-live-io/speaker`, `gemini-live-io/aec` | `/speak` command with AEC-backed speaker playback |
| `share-screen` | `gemini-live-io/screen` | `/share-screen` command |
| `transcribe` | `gemini-live-io/mic`, `gemini-live-io/aec`, `gemini-live-io/system-audio` | `gemini-live transcribe` subcommand (mic + system-audio sources) |
| `vertex-auth` | `gemini-live/vertex-auth` | `VERTEX_AUTH=adc` via Google Cloud Application Default Credentials |

Build without audio/screen support for a minimal binary:

```bash
cargo build -p gemini-live-cli --no-default-features
```

## Architecture

```
main.rs                  CLI entrypoint and event-loop composition
app.rs                   Reducer-style app state transitions for slash/runtime events
startup.rs               Profile/env resolution + default voice-first session template
session.rs               CLI dormant/hot runtime bootstrap and wake helpers
desktop.rs               CLI host wiring above `gemini-live-io`
render.rs                Terminal lifecycle + TUI rendering
input.rs                 Single-line editor wrapper built on `tui-textarea`
slash.rs                 Structured slash-command parsing (`clap`) + completion model
transcribe/              `gemini-live transcribe` mode: startup, state, render, slash, audio
media.rs                 @file loading: image/audio detection, WAV decoding, mono mixdown
outbound.rs              User-input/media send ordering above `RuntimeSession`
tooling.rs               CLI-local tool profile + host-fed ToolProvider/ToolExecutor composition
desktop_control.rs       CLI-local request-response port for model-invoked desktop controls
gemini-live-tools        Shared timer/workspace tool declarations and executors reused by hosts
gemini-live-runtime      Shared staged-setup + managed runtime orchestration reused by hosts
gemini-live-harness      Durable harness state + shared tool contracts + budget-wrapped execution
gemini-live-io           Shared desktop mic / speaker / screen adapters reused by hosts
```

The CLI now delegates session switchover, session-event forwarding, and
tool-call request fanout to `gemini-live-runtime`; shared tool execution and
budget-wrapped background handoff live in `gemini-live-harness`. The CLI starts
in a dormant state, wakes the Live session only when it has real work to do,
and returns to dormant after the idle gate clears. Slash-command and
runtime-event state reduction stay in `app.rs`, while `main.rs` uses
`tokio::select!` to concurrently poll:
1. Terminal key events (crossterm `EventStream`)
2. Runtime events (via `RuntimeEventReceiver`)
3. Microphone PCM chunks (when mic is active)
4. Screen capture JPEG frames (when sharing)

This non-blocking design means the user can type, receive model responses, and
stream audio/video simultaneously without any of these blocking each other.

The input status bar also surfaces runtime state directly: current connection
phase plus cumulative lagged-event and send-failure counters when present.

## Current Limitations

See `crates/gemini-live-cli/src/startup.rs` for the default session template
and startup semantics, and `crates/gemini-live-cli/src/desktop.rs` for desktop
host behavior. This document is intentionally kept as an entry guide rather
than the canonical home of code-representable behavior.

- Tool-profile changes are session-level and therefore require `/tools apply`.
- System-instruction changes are also setup-level and therefore require
  `/system apply`.
- CLI-local desktop tools are still part of the staged tool profile, so the
  model cannot call them until that profile has been applied to a live
  session.
- `/tools apply` and `/system apply` use session resumption carryover when the
  server has already issued a resume handle; applying immediately after first
  connect may still fail until that handle exists.
- Local tools are intentionally narrow: `read-file` only reads UTF-8 text,
  `list-files` stays inside the current workspace root, `run-command`
  executes argv-only commands without a shell, and `timer` waits for a fixed
  duration so the harness can continue it in the background when needed.
- Screen-share startup uses the saved numeric target id. If monitor/window
  ordering changes between runs, the saved target may no longer point at the
  same surface.
